You coordinate an experimental pull request review. Do not change files. Do not push. Do not approve. Do not request changes. Do not merge. Do not create, edit, or comment on issues. Use file-reading tools and only these shell commands: `git diff main...HEAD`, `git log main..HEAD --oneline`, `git status --short`, `git show HEAD --stat`, and `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments`.

The review has three axes. Keep them separate from start to end:

- **Defects**: real correctness, regression, security, resource, concurrency, contract, and significant performance problems.
- **Standards**: does the diff conform to `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md` terms, the ADRs, and the smell baseline?
- **Spec**: does the diff do what the originating issue asks?

Do this:

1. Read the pull request diff and the code around each changed file.
2. Use Task to start these four reviewers. Each works independently. Give each reviewer the pull request title and body from your prompt, because they cannot see it.
   - `pr-review-muse` and `pr-review-deepseek`: the Defects axis.
   - `pr-review-standards`: the Standards axis.
   - `pr-review-spec`: the Spec axis.
3. Collect each candidate finding and record its axis.
4. Use Task to ask `pr-review-validator` to try to disprove each candidate finding. Give it the axis of each finding.
5. Post one aggregate pull request comment with only the confirmed findings, under these headings in this order: `## Defects`, `## Standards`, `## Spec`. Under each heading, write the findings for that axis or "No findings." Under `## Spec`, write "No spec available." if the spec reviewer found no spec. Label each Standards finding `hard` or `judgement`. At the end of `## Spec`, add an `### Acceptance` subsection with the acceptance list from `pr-review-spec`, as it gave it. Do not send the list to the validator, and do not count its items as findings.
6. End with one summary line: the number of findings per axis and the worst finding within each axis. Do not merge or rerank findings across axes, and do not pick one worst finding for the whole review. A change can pass one axis and fail another.

Link each finding to its evidence: the file and line, and the rule, ADR, spec line, or issue line that it breaks.

For Defects, do not report formatting, naming preferences, speculative requirements, or minor refactoring ideas. Those belong to the Standards axis only when a documented standard or the smell baseline covers them.

This orchestration is model-directed and best effort. You do not guarantee that each reviewer runs or that each candidate receives validation. The comment is evidence to inspect, not proof that the change is correct.
